For more details on Project Plans, see the [Microsoft Project Service Description](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/project-online-service-description/project-online-service-description).

## Project Online Desktop Client

Many project managers use the Project Online desktop client as a personal productivity tool for their project management needs. They build schedules in the client, save them as .mpp files, share these files with others, and keep them updated as the project progresses.

 You can also use the Project Online Desktop Client  to [connect to a Project Online site](https://docs.microsoft.com/projectonline/connect-to-project-online-with-the-project-online-desktop-client) to take advantage of its enterprise project and portfolio management capabilities.

## Project Online

Project Online is a flexible online solution for Project Portfolio Management (PPM) and everyday work. Project Online provides powerful project management capabilities for planning, prioritizing, and managing projects and project portfolio investmentsâ€”from almost anywhere on almost any device. Project Online can be used by administrators, portfolio managers and viewers, project and resource managers,and team leads and members. 

### Platform
Project Online is built on the SharePoint platform, and uses key SharePoint features such as web parts, collaborative sites, and SharePoint security groups.  Access is provided through a supported web browser. 

Users can access their Project Online projects through the [Project Home page](https://support.office.com/article/get-started-with-project-home-a3b38418-35e7-4df4-8e4a-ba6a4fa0562a).  It will by default list projects that were recently viewed, owned, or shared with the user.

### Data Storage
Project Online data is stored to the SharePoint Content Database in Office 365. Each Project Online site created within the tenant creates a separate partition within the content database so that each instance is independent of each other. For example, custom fields used in one Project Online site are independent of another Project Online site. 

### Reporting 
You can use PowerBI Desktop to import and analyze your Project Online data. You can use the [Project Power BI template](https://docs.microsoft.com/project-for-the-web/connect-to-project-for-the-web-data-through-powerbi-desktop) to view a Portfolio dashboard of reports that can be helpful in analyzing your data.

## Project for the web
[Project for the web](https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-is-project-for-the-web-c19b2421-3c9d-4037-97c6-f66b6e1d2eb5?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us) provides simple, powerful work management capabilities to meet most needs and roles. Project managers and team members can use Project for the web to plan and manage work of any size. 

### Platform
Project for the web is built on the [Microsoft Power Platform](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com). The Power Platform consists of [PowerApps](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/powerapps-overview), [Power Automate](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-automate/getting-started), [Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/fundamentals/power-bi-overview), and the [Common Data Service (CDS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro). Project for the web data is stored in CDS. Access is provided through a supported web browser. 

Just like Project Online, users can access their Project for the web projects through the [Project Home page](https://support.office.com/article/get-started-with-project-home-a3b38418-35e7-4df4-8e4a-ba6a4fa0562a).  It will by default list projects that were recently viewed, owned, or shared with the user.

### Data storage
Project for the web data is saved to the Common Data Service (CDS). CDS is part of the Microsoft Power Platform, which Project for the web is built on.  

When Project for the web or Roadmap are first used in an Office 365 tenant, a Default CDS instance is provisioned for the tenant. Project for the web data is saved to the following [CDS Solutions](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/solutions-overview):

- Project automation core
- Universal resource scheduling
- Scheduling patch
- Scheduling

### Reporting
You can use PowerBI Desktop to import and analyze not only your Project Online data, but also your Project for the web data as well. You can use the same [Project Power BI template](https://docs.microsoft.com/project-for-the-web/connect-to-project-for-the-web-data-through-powerbi-desktop) to view a Portfolio dashboard of reports that can be helpful in analyzing your data.


## Project Roadmap
Use [Roadmap](https://support.office.com/article/Video-Welcome-to-Roadmap-57764149-51b8-468f-a50d-9ea6a4fd835a) to create a collective view of projects that are important to you. Your roadmap can connect to projects created in multiple tools, such as Project Online, Project for the web, and Azure DevOps.  

Project for the web data is saved to the Portfolio Service solution in CDS.
