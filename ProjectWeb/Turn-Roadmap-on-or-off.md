# Turn Roadmap on or off for your organization

Office 365 admins can turn the Project Online Roadmap feature on or off for their organization through their Microsoft 365 Admin settings.

## Considerations about Roadmap data deletion

Before using the Roadmap feature, admins should understand more about deleting Roadmap data, should they need to do this in the future.
  
You can turn Roadmap off in the Microsoft 365 admin center. This will prevent your users from using Roadmap, but will not remove any user data that currently exists. 

If your Project Online subscription ends, most of the associated data is deleted in conformance with the [Data Retention, Deletion, and Destruction in Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/office-365-data-retention-deletion-and-destruction-overview). Unlike other Project Online data, Roadmap data isnâ€™t automatically deleted after your Project Online subscription ends.

For more information details about deleting Roadmap data, see 
[Remove Roadmap from Office 365](remove-roadmap-from-office-365.md).

## Turn Roadmap on or off

An Office 365 admin can do the following to turn Roadmap on or off for their organization:
 
1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, under **Settings**, click **Settings**.
2. Click **Project**.
3. Set **Turn Roadmap on for your organization** to on or off with the checkbox,
4. Click **Save**.
5. After saving the settings, go to project.microsoft.com and verify that you can [create a roadmap](https://support.office.com/article/video-create-a-roadmap-6c1828da-203e-4c5b-9739-fdd837021feb?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US).

## Make sure you have the correct license

Your Office 365 tenant needs to have a **Project Plan 3** or **Project Plan 5** license in order to use the Roadmap feature.  The Project settings in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center will not be available if your Office 365 tenant does not have at least one of these licenses.

> [!NOTE]
> Roadmap is currently not available in the Project Plan 3 and Project Plan 5 EDU licenses. This includes: 
>* Project Plan 3 for Faculty
>* Project Plan 5 for Faculty 
>* Project Plan 3 for Students
>* Project Plan 5 for Students 

The **Project Plan 3** or **Project Plan 5** license assigned to a user will provide three service plans that will allow the user to use the Roadmap feature. The **Project P3**, **Data integration for Project with Flow**, and **Common Data Service for Project** service plans directly support the infrastructure of running Roadmap.  All three must be turned on for Roadmap to work for the user.
