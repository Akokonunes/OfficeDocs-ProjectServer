# Turn off Project for the web

Access to Project for the web is granted to users if they are assigned a Project P3 or Project P5 license (previously called Project Online Professional and Project Online Premium). An admin can manage access by assigning and unassigning the associated licenses. If you want to turn off Project for the web for specific users in your organization, an admin can do this by turning off the service for the user in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.  

You might want to do this if your users currently use Project Online and you don't want to give all of your users access to Project for the web at the moment.

> [!NOTE]
> Turning off Project for the web for the user will also turn off the Roadmap feature.

To turn off Project for the web for a user:

1. In the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, select **Users**, then select **Active Users**.
2. From the **Active users** list, select the checkbox next to the user, and then click **Manage product licenses**.</br>

3.  On the user information page, select the **licenses and app** tab, in the **Apps** section,  select the user's Project Online license from the **Show apps for** drop down menu. This would be either Project Online Professional or Project Online Premium.
4. In the list of apps that display, uncheck **Project P3**, and then click **Save changes**.</br>

You can repeat this procedure for each user that you don't want to use Project for the web.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only turn off Project for the web to one user at a time through the Office 365 Admin Center user interface.  You also cannot turn Project for the web off to your organization (like you can for Roadmap in the Project Online settings in the Office 365 Admin Center).
