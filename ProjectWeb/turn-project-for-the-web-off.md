# Turn off Project for the web

If you want to disable Project for the web for specific users in your organization, an admin can do this by disabling the service for the user in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.  

A scenario where you might want to do this is if your users currently use Project Online Professional or Project Online Premium and you don't want to give all of your users access to Project for the web at the moment.

> [!NOTE]
> Disabling Project for the web will also disable the Roadmap feature, even if you have Roadmap enabled in the Project Online Settings in Microsoft 365 Admin Center.

To turn off Project for the web for a user:

1. In the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, select **Users**, then select **Active Users**.
2. From the **Active users** list, select the checkbox next to the user, and then click **Manage product licenses**.</br>

3.  On the user information page, select the **licenses and app** tab, in the **Apps** section,  select the user's Project Online license from the **Show apps for** drop down menu. This would be either Project Online Professional or Project Online Premium.
4. In the list of apps that display, uncheck **Project P3**, and then click **Save changes**.</br>

You can repeat this procedure for each user that you don't want to use Project for the web.

> [!NOTE]
> There is no way to turn off Project for the web to more than one user at a time or through your organization through the Microsoft 365 admin center user interface.
