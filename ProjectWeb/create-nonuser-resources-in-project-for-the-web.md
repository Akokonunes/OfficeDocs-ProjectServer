# Add non-user resources in Project for the web

Project for the web is built on the [Microsoft Power Platform](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/en-us/), and some aspects of resource setup for Project for the web is done in Dynamics 365, such as how to add resources that are not users in your organization (for example, contacts, equipment, or facilities) and making them available to assign to tasks.

While Office 365 user accounts with access to Project for the web are automatically available as resources to assign to project tasks, you need to manually add non-user resources.

## Types of non-user resources

Some of the more commonly used non-user resources you will be able to add include:

|||
|:-----|:-----|
|**Name** <br/> |**Description** <br/> |
|Contact   <br/> |The resource is not directly a part of your organization, but needs to be scheduled. A common example is subcontractors.  <br/> |
|Equipment <br/> |The resource is a piece of equipment, tool, or machine that must be scheduled.  <br/> |
|Facility   <br/> |The resource is a physical space that needs to be scheduled, such as a building or room. <br/> |

For more information about other non-user resources you can add, see [Set up a bookable resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/field-service/set-up-bookable-resources#add-work-hours). 


## Create a non-work resource

You first need to go to the Dynamics 365 Project Resources page:
1. While logged into Office 365, open a browser window and go to <spam><spam>**https://web.powerapps.com**<spam><spam>.
2. On the PowerApps page, select **Apps**.
3. On the Apps page, in the Org Apps tab, select **Project**.
4. On the Project page, in the left pane, select **Resources**.


When you get to the resources page, do the following:
1. On the Resources page, click **New**.
2. On tne New Bookable Resource page, click in the **Resource Type** field, and select the resource type you need to create.

3. Provide the information needed for the resource type you selected.
4. In the **Name** field, type the name your want to give the resource.
6. When youâ€™re done, click **Save and Close**.

The new resource will display in the Bookable Resources page and can be assigned to tasks in Project for the web.
