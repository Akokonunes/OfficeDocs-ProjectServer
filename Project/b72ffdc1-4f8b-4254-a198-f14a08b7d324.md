Project Web App enables you to easily track the time you spend on a project's tasks, and the progress of those tasks toward completion. You can also enter time spent on administrative tasks, like vacation, travel, training, and sick leave. Depending on your organization's configuration of Project Web App, you can enter time and task progress by using the same view, or by using separate views.
  
    
    


## Time vs. task progress: What's the difference?

It's important to make sure we're clear on the differences between time and task progress.

 <br/> |**Time** is the actual number of hours you spend working on a specific task. This is what you fill out on your timesheet, to capture the number of hours you spent on different things during your work week.

 <br/> |**Task progress** is an umbrella term for things like the percent of work that is complete for a task (percent complete), and how much work is left to do before the task is finished (remaining work). Submitting task progress is a way to capture a broader description of how you think things are going with your tasks. <br/> |
   

## Need help?

If you get stuck, you can try a few different things:
  
    
    

- **Ask other team members!** The people you work with are often the best source of information about working in Project Web App. They're familiar with how your organization has customized things, and what processes are in place. If you need help, don't be shy! Your coworkers may be just as confused as you are, and working together may make things easier.
    
  
- **Search on support.office.com.** Articles on [support.office.com](https://support.office.com) are designed to help you learn how to use Project Web App, but may not cover specific details about how your organization has things set up.
    
  
- **Ask the Project community!** The [Project community](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/en-us/category/project) on TechNet is often very active, with subject matter experts responding to posts. This makes the community a great resource for finding other people who may have worked through similar issues, or who have encountered the same situation.
    
  
- **And if none of that works, ask your administrator!** When you simply can't find the answer you're looking for, try asking your Project Web App administrator. If you don't know who that is, ask aroundâ€¦one of your coworkers can probably point you in the right direction.
