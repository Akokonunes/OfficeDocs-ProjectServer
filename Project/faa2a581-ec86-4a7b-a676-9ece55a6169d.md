 <br/> |**[Project Online](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=402127) is web-based, and is great for:** <br/>  Managing multiple projects. <br/>  Tracking work on timesheets. <br/>  Balancing broad resource needs. <br/>  *(If you're looking for a hosted version of Project Server, this is it!)*  <br/> |
|||
||**[Project Online Desktop Client](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=402129) is a downloaded desktop program, and is great for:** <br/>  Detailed project planning. <br/>  Managing resource calendars. <br/>  Rich analysis of project work. <br/>  *(If you're looking for a subscription-based version of Project Professional, this is it!)*  <br/> |
   
 **To be clear, Project Online is NOT a web-based version of Project Professional.** Project Online is an entirely separate service that offers full portfolio and project management tools on the web. It includes Project Web App, and can, if you're a subscriber, also include Project Online Desktop Client.
  
    
    

## Got the wrong thing?

 **If you need to cancel and subscribe to something else,** choose **Billing** > **Subscriptions** in the Office 365 admin center, choose the subscription you want to cancel, and then click **Cancel subscription** in the pane on the right. Then, you can find the right product to subscribe to and add that to your existing Office 365 account.
