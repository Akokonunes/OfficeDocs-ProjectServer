 **We are in the process of combining the Project Server 2013 and Project Server 2016 content into a single content set. We appreciate your patience while we reorganize things. See the Applies To tag at the top of each article to find out which version of Project Server an article applies to.**
Allows you to change the Microsoft Project Server Events Service 2016 TCP port settings. If you change the TCP port, the Microsoft Project Server Events Service 2016 needs to be restarted for the changes to take effect.
  
    
    


```

Set-SPProjectEventServiceSettings [-AssignmentCollection <SPAssignmentCollection>] [-NetTcpPort <Int32>]

```


## Example

This example tells the service to listen on port 16100.
  
    
    

```

Set-SPProjectEventServiceSettings -NetTcpPort 16100
```


## Parameters



|**Parameter**|**Required**|**Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _AssignmentCollection_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.SharePoint.PowerShell.SPAssignmentCollection  <br/> |Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal. Use of objects, such as **SPWeb** or **SPSite**, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management. Using the **SPAssignment** object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory. When **SPWeb**, **SPSite**, or **SPSiteAdministration** objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the **Global** parameter is not used. <br/> > [!NOTE]> When the **Global** parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store. If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the **Stop-SPAssignment** command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.          |
| _NetTcpPort_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Int32  <br/> |TCP port to listen on.  <br/> |
