## What's in the set of sample reports?

In Project Online, you get three sample reports that provide high-level details about all your projects. Each report uses some combination of the six prebuilt OData data connections that come with Project Online. Using OData data sources enables people to refresh the data while viewing each workbook in a browser window. The following sections provide more details about the sample reports.

This view shows planned assignment work alongside completed assignment work.

Risks and Issues information about your projects will also show up in this report.

## What if more reports are needed?

Most likely, you'll want to create your own reports to view and track your projects. The sample reports are intended to provide a starting point for you; those reports are not intended to be your overall project reporting solution. You can easily create new reports that you can use in addition to (or instead of) the sample reports.
