 **We are in the process of combining the Project Server 2013 and Project Server 2016 content into a single content set. We appreciate your patience while we reorganize things. See the Applies To tag at the top of each article to find out which version of Project Server an article applies to.**
Copies the data from the Project Server 2013 database into the corresponding SharePoint Server 2016 content database containing the migrated site collection. 
  
    
    

Both the Project Server 2013 database and the SharePoint Server 2016 database must be on the same instance of SQL Server and the SharePoint farm account must have full access to the Project Server 2013 database. During the migration process the Project Server 2013 database will be modified and cannot be mounted back to a Project Server 2013.
```

Migrate-SPProjectDatabase -DatabaseName <String> -SiteCollection <SPSitePipeBind> [-DatabaseServer <String>] [-FailoverPartner <String>] [-Overwrite <SwitchParameter>] [-SQLLogon <PSCredential>] [-AssignmentCollection <SPAssignmentCollection>] [-Confirm [<SwitchParameter>]] [-WhatIf [<SwitchParameter>]]

```


## Example

This example will look for a Project Server 2013 database named ProjectDB1 on the same instance of SQL Server where the content database containing http://contoso1/sites/PWA is located. The data will be upgraded and copied into the site collection.
  
    
    

```

Migrate-SPProjectDatabase -Name ProjectDB1 -SiteCollection "http://contoso1/sites/PWA"
```


## Parameters



|**Parameter**|**Required**|**Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _DatabaseName_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |System.String  <br/> |The name of the Project Server 2013 database.  <br/> |
| _SiteCollection_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |Microsoft.SharePoint.PowerShell.SPSitePipeBind  <br/> |The URL of the site collection to which you want to copy the Project data.  <br/> |
| _AssignmentCollection_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.SharePoint.PowerShell.SPAssignmentCollection  <br/> |Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal. Use of objects, such as **SPWeb** or **SPSite**, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management. Using the **SPAssignment** object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory. When **SPWeb**, **SPSite**, or **SPSiteAdministration** objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the **Global** parameter is not used. <br/> > [!NOTE]> When the **Global** parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store. If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the **Stop-SPAssignment** command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.          |
| _Confirm_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |Prompts you for confirmation before executing the command. For more information, type the following command: **get-help about_commonparameters** <br/> |
| _DatabaseServer_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.String  <br/> |The name of the instance of SQL Server hosting the Project Server 2013 database.  <br/> |
| _FailoverPartner_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.String  <br/> |The name of the SQL Server failover partner for the Project Server 2013 database.  <br/> |
| _Overwrite_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |Specifies to overwrite any Project data from previous attempts.  <br/> |
| _SQLLogon_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.PSCredential  <br/> |SQL Server authentication credentials if needed.  <br/> |
| _WhatIf_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |Displays a message that describes the effect of the command instead of executing the command. For more information, type the following command: **get-help about_commonparameters** <br/> |
