 Project Online allows you to have seven site collections with Project Web App. If you have seven sites, and you delete one using the steps above, Project Online will continue to count the deleted site as one of your seven sites until it is permanently deleted from the Recycle Bin in 30 days.
  
    
    
If you would rather not wait 30 days to free up a Project Web App site, you can disable Project Web App on a site collection.

5. Select **Disable**.
    
  
After you disable Project Web App, you don't have to delete the site collection. When you are at your seven-site limit, disabling Project Web App is enough to make it so that you can create a new Project Web App site.
