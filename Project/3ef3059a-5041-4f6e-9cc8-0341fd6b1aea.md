As you work on a project, you may find it useful to  [Add a risk to a project](7aa1acc9-50cf-4f15-ac3b-fedf41b31c83.md),  [Add an issue to a project](3e1a59e5-43b3-4281-9cfb-503c646f49b9.md),  [Upload files to a library](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/da549fb1-1fcb-4167-87d0-4693e93cb7a0%28Office.14%29.aspx), and list deliverables on the project site. Sometimes, these risks, issues, files, and deliverables are tied to specific tasks within the project. By linking these items to their related tasks, you give yourself a reminder of where you need to keep an eye on things, or where you have files that you might need to refer to or keep updated.
  
    
    

You can link things together by  [starting with the risk, issue, file, or deliverable](3ef3059a-5041-4f6e-9cc8-0341fd6b1aea.md#BKMK_StartFromItem), or by  [starting with the task](3ef3059a-5041-4f6e-9cc8-0341fd6b1aea.md#BKMK_StartFromTask).
