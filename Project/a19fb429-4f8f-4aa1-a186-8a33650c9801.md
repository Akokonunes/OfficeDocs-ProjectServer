## Video: Permissions for security groups
<a name="__toc261529017"> </a>

This video explains groups in Project Server. Groups contain sets of users who have similar functionality needs. For example, every project manager in a particular division within your organization may need the same set of Project Server permissions, while executives or resource managers might have different needs.

## Video: Permissions for security categories
<a name="__toc261529018"> </a>

This video explains categories in Project Server. Categories are collections of projects, resources, and views. Categories define the scope of the information accessible to a given user. A category is similar to a group in that it provides permissions to users.

## Video: Resource Breakdown Structure
<a name="__toc261529019"> </a>

This video explains RBS (Resource Breakdown Structure) in Project Server. An RBS is a hierarchical security structure typically based on the management reporting structure of your organization. The RBS can be an important element in your Project Server security model when it is used to define the reporting relationships among users and projects in your organization.
