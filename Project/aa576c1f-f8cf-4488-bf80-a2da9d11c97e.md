## Each dashboard has different sections

## Drill down for more detail

In some places, more information is displayed right on the chart. In other spots, another page is shown to drill into greater detail. To drill down, try selecting an area or row of a chart or table.

## Change what's included on a dashboard

The **Options** tab includes all settings for the current dashboard, including the filters that define which projects are included, the charts displayed within each section, and the filters that are available when viewing the dashboard. These are the same options you have when you [Create a portfolio dashboard](eb09494b-f2e5-451d-8b88-3257d055c6d4.md).
