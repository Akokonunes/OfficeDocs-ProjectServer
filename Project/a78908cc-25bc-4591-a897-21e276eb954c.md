 **We are in the process of combining the Project Server 2013 and Project Server 2016 content into a single content set. We appreciate your patience while we reorganize things. See the Applies To tag at the top of each article to find out which version of Project Server an article applies to.** **Summary:** Deploy an instance of Project Web App to an existing site collection and create a Project Web App site.
Deploying an instance of Project Web App to an existing site collection consists of the following:
  
    
    


- Create a Project Web App site
    
  
- Enable the Project Web App site collection features
    
  

If you have already enabled the Project Web App site collection features (for example, if you imported SharePoint list projects into Project Web App), then a Project Web App instance already exists in the site collection, and you can proceed to create a Project Web App site.
  
    
    


> [!NOTE]
> Only one Project Web App site can be created per site collection. 
  
    
    

For information on enabling the Project Web App site collection features, see  [Enable the Project Web App site collection features in Project Server 2016](b9c4dff2-4812-4131-8b20-4b7766d93233.md).For information on creating a Project Web App site in an existing site collection, see  [Create a PWA site in an existing site collection](bd4e7c9f-79f7-45c4-8cbe-8dbe75c72370.md).
