 **We are in the process of combining the Project Server 2013 and Project Server 2016 content into a single content set. We appreciate your patience while we reorganize things. See the Applies To tag at the top of each article to find out which version of Project Server an article applies to.**
Defines the threshold over which a user sync job will not be executed but instead will be deleted. This threshold is the product of the number of projects multiplied by the number of users.
  
    
    


```

Set-SPProjectUserSyncDisabledSyncThreshold [-Url] <Uri> [-Threshold] <Int32> [-AssignmentCollection <SPAssignmentCollection>]
```


## Detailed Description

The Set- **SPProjectUserSyncDisabledSyncThreshold** cmdlet d the threshold over which a user sync job will not be executed but instead will be deleted. This threshold is the product of the number of projects multiplied by the number of users. The purpose of configuring this threshold is to prevent malicious user syncs of the whole server. Set it to a negative value to reset to default value (not set).
  
    
    

> [!NOTE]
> This cmdlet only works in Project Server Permission mode. 
  
    
    


## Parameters



|**Parameter**|**Required**|**Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|**Url** <br/> |Required  <br/> |System.Uri  <br/> |The URL of the Project Web App instance where you want to set the threshold.  <br/> |
|**Threshold** <br/> |Required  <br/> |System.Int32  <br/> |A whole number consisting of the number of projects multiplied by the number of users.  <br/> |
|**AssignmentCollection** <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.SharePoint.PowerShell.SPAssignmentCollection  <br/> |Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal. Use of objects, such as **SPWeb** or **SPSite**, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management. Using the **SPAssignment** object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory. When **SPWeb**, **SPSite**, or **SPSiteAdministration** objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the **Global** parameter is not used. <br/> > [!NOTE]> When the **Global** parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store. If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the **Stop-SPAssignment** command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.          |

## Example

--------------------EXAMPLE--------------------- 
  
    
    

```
Set-SPProjectUserSyncDisabledSyncThreshold -URL http//contoso-AppSrv/PWA -Threshold 400
