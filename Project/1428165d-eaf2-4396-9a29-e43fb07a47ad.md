
# Hand off work to someone else

There are a lot of reasons why you might reassign one of your tasks to someone else, for example:
  
    
    


- Maybe you're pulled into another, higher-priority project, and you need someone else to take on part of your existing workload.
    
  
- Maybe another person on the team has more experience than you do with a certain aspect of the project, and your project manager asks you to transition your work to that person.
    
  
- Orâ€¦maybe you're just really good at delegating.
    
  
To assign a task to someone else:
1. Click **Tasks** on the Quick Launch.
