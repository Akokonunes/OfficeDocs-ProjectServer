## Detailed Description

The **Repair-SPProjectWebInstance** cmdlet re-queues specific Project Server queue items that may have fallen out of the queue. This includes triggers that may have been missed and queue jobs that were enqueued on a server that was subsequently removed from the farm.
  
    
    

## Parameters



|**Parameter**|**Required**|**Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Identity_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |Microsoft.Office.Project.Server.Cmdlet.ProjectInstancePipeBind  <br/> |The identity of the instance of Project Web App.  <br/> |
| _RepairRule_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |Microsoft.Office.Project.Server.HealthRules.ProjectSiteHealthRuleName  <br/> |Valid values: **QueueMissingTriggers** searches the Project Web App for any triggers that might have been missed; **QueueStaleServerGroups** re-queues any jobs that were picked up by a server that was subsequently removed from the farm. <br/> |
| _AssignmentCollection_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.SharePoint.PowerShell.SPAssignmentCollection  <br/> |Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal. Use of objects, such as **SPWeb** or **SPSite**, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management. Using the **SPAssignment** object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory. When **SPWeb**, **SPSite**, or **SPSiteAdministration** objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the **Global** parameter is not used. <br/> > [!NOTE]> When the **Global** parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store. If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the **Stop-SPAssignment** command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.          |
   

## AutoGenParams
