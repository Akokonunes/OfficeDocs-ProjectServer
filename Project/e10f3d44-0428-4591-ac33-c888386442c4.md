|:-----|:-----|
|Team members are the people who are doing the day-to-day work on projects. Once they're assigned tasks in Project Online, team members are responsible for things like turning in timesheets, managing their tasks, and collaborating with others.  <br/> |

 <br/> | Timesheets are at the core of what team members will do in Project Online. Yes, there are other things they can do, but if you ask a team member what Project Online is for, they'll most likely tell you it's for filling out timesheets. <br/>  Team members can: <br/>  [Enter hours on your timesheet](a44e4d20-a5f0-4f36-94c0-d0abeca8366f.md) on a timesheet <br/>  [Add a task to your timesheet](4fed12e4-7b1a-4a6e-acd9-eca29eb78304.md) to a timesheet <br/>  Enter hours that aren't part of a project <br/>  Add comments to a timesheet <br/>  [Capture vacation, sick leave, and other non-project hours](bd641e87-4b35-4011-906f-340bbd50cad8.md) on a timesheet <br/>  [Step 2: Turn in a timesheet](f49a8e4a-29d2-4601-ac5a-437c232c31f1.md) <br/> |

 <br/> | Team members also need to communicate with project managers about their tasks. <br/>  Team members can: <br/>  [Report your task progress](4e338fec-6e78-4b0e-b059-11422057df31.md) as percent complete and remaining work <br/>  Add comments to task progress <br/>  [Create a new task](99b036ba-8207-4702-a3fc-14c49f913683.md) to a project <br/>  Assign themselves to existing tasks <br/>  [Hand off work to someone else](1428165d-eaf2-4396-9a29-e43fb07a47ad.md) (if it makes sense in your organization) <br/> |

 <br/> | Team members typically need to work together to get things done. <br/>  Team members can: <br/>  Add information about project [Add an issue to a project](3e1a59e5-43b3-4281-9cfb-503c646f49b9.md) and [Add a risk to a project](7aa1acc9-50cf-4f15-ac3b-fedf41b31c83.md) <br/>  Store and work on project [View a project document](8e26009f-2c19-465c-868e-daa47a31b404.md) <br/>  Link issues, risks, and documents to specific tasks <br/>  [View a list of projects](71716c1f-c2e8-4fea-be9e-3c0b657252a4.md) <br/>  View updates that have been submitted for approval <br/>  View who's assigned to work across your organization <br/> |

They're familiar with how your organization has customized things, and what processes are in place. If you need help, don't be shy! Your coworkers may be just as confused as you are, and working together may make things easier.
