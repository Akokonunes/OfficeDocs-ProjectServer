There are several ways you can set up time and task progress for your organization in Project Web App.
  
    
    


1. **First, decide  [Set up how time and task progress are captured](55825b21-1a20-4d40-9f26-0ec91bf920d3.md) in your organization.** Do you want it reported in a timesheet, along with the hours a team member has completed, or do you want it split out?
    
  
2. **Next, consider different ways you might  [Customize timesheets and task progress for your organization](f787d680-223b-4aa7-92e0-5fc32ed3c962.md).** Every organization does things differently, and there are several settings that let you control what gets reported.
    
  
3. **Figure out  [Set up time and task progress approval](ac06db07-b8c3-4f58-be63-af68fa974a27.md).** Is the project manager the only person who needs to approve things? Or are more people involved, like a resource manager or a payroll specialist?
    
  
4. **Refine your settings by  [Set up policies for capturing time and task progress](c1da8a04-d5d7-4965-bb43-48f1c50bef1b.md).** Generally it's good to keep things simple, but sometimes you just can't avoid complexity (especially when timesheets are involved!).
