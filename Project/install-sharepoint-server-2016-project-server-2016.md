# Install SharePoint Server 2016 (Project Server 2016)
 **We are in the process of combining the Project Server 2013 and Project Server 2016 content into a single content set. We appreciate your patience while we reorganize things. See the Applies To tag at the top of each article to find out which version of Project Server an article applies to.**
 **Summary:** Install SharePoint Server 2016 and create a server farm prior to installing Project Server 2016.
  
Before you can configure Project Server 2016, you must [install SharePoint Server 2016](install-sharepoint-server-2016-project-server-2016.md) and create a SharePoint Server 2016 farm.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Project Server 2016 requires the Enterprise edition of SharePoint Server 2016. 
  
If you have a SharePoint Server 2016 farm configured and you are ready to install Project Server 2016, proceed to the next article, [Install and configure Project Server 2016](install-and-configure-project-server-2016.md).
  
See [Install and configure SharePoint Server 16 Preview](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/8a911115-de8a-4cf3-9701-f5ba78fa8bfc.aspx) for detailed information about deploying SharePoint Server 2016.
  
When you have completed SharePoint Server 2016 deployment, proceed to [Install and configure Project Server 2016](install-and-configure-project-server-2016.md).
