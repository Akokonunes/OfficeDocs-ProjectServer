 **We are in the process of combining the Project Server 2013 and Project Server 2016 content into a single content set. We appreciate your patience while we reorganize things. See the Applies To tag at the top of each article to find out which version of Project Server an article applies to.** **Summary:** Add a Project Web App site to an existing site collection.
You can add a Project Web App site to an existing site collection. Doing so will allow you to take full advantage of Project Server 2016 and Project Web App functionality for the projects in that site collection.
  
    
    

In order for a Project Web App site to function properly, the Project Web App site collection features must be enabled. If you have not already done so,  [enable the Project Web App site collection features](b9c4dff2-4812-4131-8b20-4b7766d93233.md) on the site collection where you want to deploy the Project Web App site.
To create a Project Web App site in an existing site collection, you run the New-SPWeb Microsoft PowerShell cmdlet to create the site. Run the following script to create the Project Web App site.
  
    
    




```

New-SPweb -URL SiteCollectionURL/PWASiteName -Template pwa#0

```

For example:


```

New-SPweb -URL http://contoso-appsrv1/sites/ContosoProjects/PWA -Template pwa#0

```

The Project Web App site is now available at the URL that you specified.
