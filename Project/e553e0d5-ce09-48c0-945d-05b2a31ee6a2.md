 **We are in the process of combining the Project Server 2013 and Project Server 2016 content into a single content set. We appreciate your patience while we reorganize things. See the Applies To tag at the top of each article to find out which version of Project Server an article applies to.**
Disables task sync between Project Web App and the associated project site. Once this is disabled, tasks created in the enterprise project in Project Web App will no longer sync to the task list on the project site associated with the project. This feature is disabled by default.
  
    
    


```

Disable-SPProjectEnterpriseProjectTaskSync -Url <Uri> [-AssignmentCollection <SPAssignmentCollection>]

```


## Example


  
    
    

```

Disable-SPProjectEnterpriseProjectTaskSync  -URL http://contoso/sites/PWA
```

This example shows the syntax for disabling task sync for the projects in the Project Web App site at http://contoso/sites/PWA.
  
    
    

## Parameters



|**Parameter**|**Required**|**Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Url_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |System.Uri  <br/> |The URL of the PWA site.  <br/> |
| _AssignmentCollection_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.SharePoint.PowerShell.SPAssignmentCollection  <br/> |Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal. Use of objects, such as **SPWeb** or **SPSite**, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management. Using the **SPAssignment** object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory. When **SPWeb**, **SPSite**, or **SPSiteAdministration** objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the **Global** parameter is not used. <br/> > [!NOTE]> When the **Global** parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store. If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the **Stop-SPAssignment** command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.          |
