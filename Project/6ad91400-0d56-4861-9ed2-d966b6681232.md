 **We are in the process of combining the Project Server 2013 and Project Server 2016 content into a single content set. We appreciate your patience while we reorganize things. See the Applies To tag at the top of each article to find out which version of Project Server an article applies to.**
Switches the specified instance of Project Web App to read-only, preventing any changes from being made through the Project Server 2016 PSI or CSOM.
  
    
    


```

Pause-SPProjectWebInstance -Identity <ProjectInstancePipeBind> [-AssignmentCollection <SPAssignmentCollection>]

```


## Detailed Description

Switches the specified instance of Project Web App to read-only, preventing any changes from being made through the Project Server 2016 Project Server Interface (PSI) or Client Server Object Model (CSOM). While in this state the database is not actually read-only, and the Queue service can still write to the database, but it will not pick up any new jobs to process. This cmdlet is used to allow the queue to empty out before an administrator switches the database to read-only.
  
    
    

## Parameters



|**Parameter**|**Required**|**Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Identity_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |Microsoft.Office.Project.Server.Cmdlet.ProjectInstancePipeBind  <br/> |Specifies the instance of Project Web App to be switched to read-only mode. It can be the unique id of the instance, the URL of the Project Web App site, the site collection object that contains the Project Web App site (an SPSite), or the Project Web App instance object itself (a PSSite).  <br/> |
| _AssignmentCollection_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.SharePoint.PowerShell.SPAssignmentCollection  <br/> |Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal. Use of objects, such as **SPWeb** or **SPSite**, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management. Using the **SPAssignment** object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory. When **SPWeb**, **SPSite**, or **SPSiteAdministration** objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the **Global** parameter is not used. <br/> > [!NOTE]> When the **Global** parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store. If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the **Stop-SPAssignment** command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.          |
