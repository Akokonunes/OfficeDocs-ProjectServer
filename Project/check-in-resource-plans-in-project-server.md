# Check-in resource plans in Project Server
 **We are in the process of combining the Project Server 2013 and Project Server 2016 content into a single content set. We appreciate your patience while we reorganize things. See the Applies To tag at the top of each article to find out which version of Project Server an article applies to.**
 **Summary:** You can force the check-in an enterprise resource plan by using Project Web App Settings.
  
You can force the check-in of an enterprise resource plan that is checked out. Note that forcing a check-in of a resource plan that is being modified by a user may result in the loss of those changes.
  
Use the following procedure to force check-in resource plans.
  
### To force check-in resource plans

1. On the Project Web App home page, on the **Settings** menu, click **Project Web App Settings**.
    
2. On the Server Settings page, in the **Queue and Database Administration** section, click **Force Check-in Enterprise Objects**.
    
3. From the **Select the type of object you want to force check-in** drop-down list, select **Resource Plans**.
    
4. Select the resource plans that you want to check in.
    
5. Click **Check In**.
