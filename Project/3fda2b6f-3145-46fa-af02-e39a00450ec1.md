 <br/> | It may seem a little backwards, but after you sign up, the first thing you should do is **make sure your account is assigned a Project Online license**. Some accounts are and some aren't. <br/> **To check if you're assigned a license:** <br/>  Choose **Users** > **Active Users** from the left menu on the Office 365 admin center. <br/>  Choose your account. <br/>  Confirm that the **Project Online** is listed under **Product licenses**.  <br/> **Even if, as the administrator, you don't actually plan to use Project Online,** the only way you'll be able to see that Project Online is, in fact, included in your Office 365 account is by giving yourself a license to use it. You can go back in later and remove your license to free it up for another user, if needed. <br/> |

Don't panic if yours is taking longer! <br/> When you come back to check on setup, refresh the page. If you see **Project** listed in the app launcher
