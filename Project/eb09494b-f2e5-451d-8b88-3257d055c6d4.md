If the dashboards that are included with Office 365 Project Portfolio Dashboard aren't quite showing what you'd like them to, you can create your own new dashboard that is shared with your organization.
  
    
    


1. Choose **Dashboards** > **Create**.

2. On the **New Dashboard** tab, give the dashboard a **Name** and **Description**.
    
  
3. Choose **Included Projects** on the left side of the **New Dashboard** tab, to continue setting up your new dashboard.
