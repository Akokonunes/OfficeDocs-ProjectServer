 **We are in the process of combining the Project Server 2013 and Project Server 2016 content into a single content set. We appreciate your patience while we reorganize things. See the Applies To tag at the top of each article to find out which version of Project Server an article applies to.**
Enables all Project Server functionality in the farm. The cmdlet depends on the farm having a valid SharePoint Server license (trials are allowed). Any existing Project Web App sites will become read/write. A Project Server Trial key will only be accepted if the farm has never had a Project Server trial key previously.
  
    
    


```

Enable-ProjectServerLicense -Key <String> [-AssignmentCollection <SPAssignmentCollection>]

```


## Example

This example enables all Project Server functionality in the farm. The type of license being enabled (full or trial) depends on the key that is passed in.
  
    
    

```

Enable-ProjectServerLicense -Key XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX
```


## Parameters



|**Parameter**|**Required**|**Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Key_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |System.String  <br/> |License key (trial or full).  <br/> |
| _AssignmentCollection_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.SharePoint.PowerShell.SPAssignmentCollection  <br/> |Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal. Use of objects, such as **SPWeb** or **SPSite**, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management. Using the **SPAssignment** object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory. When **SPWeb**, **SPSite**, or **SPSiteAdministration** objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the **Global** parameter is not used. <br/> > [!NOTE]> When the **Global** parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store. If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the **Stop-SPAssignment** command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.          |
