After you have shared your Project Web App site with a user, you can add that user as a resource. Resources are the people, materials, or costs that are required to get your project done.
  
    
    

To add a resource to the resource pool in Project Web App:
1. Click **Resources** on the Quick Launch.
    
  
2. Click **Resources** > **New**.
    
  
3. Choose a **Type** for the new resource:
    
  - **Work** resources are the people who complete the tasks in your project.
    
  
  - **Material** resources are the tools you need to get your project done. These may include things like vehicles, computers, or conference rooms.
    
  
  - **Cost** resources are fees associated with your project. These may be things like lodging or airfare.
    
  
4. Select the **Budget** check box if you are adding a resource that will help you track your project budget.
    
  
5. Select the **Generic** check box if you are adding a resource that will represent an overall resource category, such as Developer or Contractor.
    
  
6. In the **Identification Information** section, select the **Resource can logon to Project Web App** check box if you want the resource to be able to log on and submit a timesheet, enter task progress, or view your project in Project Web App. This is typically only applicable for Work resources.
    
  
7. Do one of the following:
    
  - If you selected the **Resource can logon to Project Web App** check box, in the **User Authentication**section, type the resource's name or email address in the **User logon account**box. 
    
  
  - If you did not select the **Resource can logon to Project Web App** check box, type a **Display Name** for the resource, and then enter an **Email Address**, **RBS** identifier, and **Initials**, if appropriate.
    
  
8. Choose the appropriate **Assignment Attributes** for the resource. [More about Assignment Attributes](71c6aa5c-2a97-4cbb-9814-26289c62c471.md#BKMK_AssignmentAttributes)
    
  
9. Choose a **Resource Department**, if appropriate.
    
  
10. In the **Group Fields** section, enter a **Group**, **Code**, **Cost Center**, and **Cost Type**, if appropriate.
    
  
11. In the **Team Details** section, if your organization uses teams in Project Web App, choose the options that make the most sense for this resource.
    
  
12. Click **Save**.
