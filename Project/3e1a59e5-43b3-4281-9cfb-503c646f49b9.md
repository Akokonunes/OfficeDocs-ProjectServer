As you work on a project, issues may come up along the way that have an impact on the project schedule. Maybe someone you need to talk to is unexpectedly out of the office for a while, or a tool you need to get the work done isn't available. By recording the issues that come up as the project progresses, project managers are better able to manage the project schedule.
