 <br/> | Projects in your organization may require people, equipment, or locations to help complete the work, and costs that help financially back the work being done. These requirements are referred to as "resources," and Project Web App includes a Resource Center to help plan for your organization's resource requirements. <br/>  [Add a resource to Project Web App](71c6aa5c-2a97-4cbb-9814-26289c62c471.md) <br/>  [Overview: Resource engagements](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/73eefb5a-81fe-42bf-980e-9532b1bdc870%28Office.14%29.aspx) <br/>  [Add or update enterprise resources using an external data file](1784a91a-0491-4381-bc2d-400ffc7182c7.md) <br/> |

 <br/> | As your project progresses, you may want team members to report the time that they have spent on different tasks in your project, as well as other administrative time, such as sick leave, vacation, or even things like travel and training. You may want to know the progress being made on tasks in your project, so that you can monitor whether your project is on track, or if things are running behind. <br/>  [Track your time and task progress](b72ffdc1-4f8b-4254-a198-f14a08b7d324.md) <br/>  [Enter hours on your timesheet](a44e4d20-a5f0-4f36-94c0-d0abeca8366f.md) <br/>  [Report your task progress](4e338fec-6e78-4b0e-b059-11422057df31.md) <br/> |

 <br/> |Sometimes, a lot of people have a lot of great ideas for projects that your organization could benefit from. Sorting through all of those ideas can be challenging, especially when there are so many things to consider: alignment with your organization's business drivers, high-level cost constraints, and resource scheduling requirements. Project Web App provides portfolio management features that can guide you through all of the proposed projects in your organization, helping you make strategic decisions on which proposals should move forward as projects.  <br/> |
