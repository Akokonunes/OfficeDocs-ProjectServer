 **At this point, if you really want to, you can dive right in and  [Create a project in Project Web App](072e676d-d798-457d-a4d1-66baaaf6c552.md)!** Everything is there for you to just jump in and run. But...there are a few things that you can set up now, to make Project Online more useful for your organization.

 <br/> |**Got users in different time zones?** Project Online stores times and dates in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) format, and then converts times to the local time zone of your Project Web App site when you view a page. If you have users in time zones outside [the time zone for your Project Web App site](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/e9e189c7-16e3-45d3-a090-770be6e83c1a%28Office.14%29.aspx), you should have them  [change their personal time zone settings to match their location](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/CAA1FCCC-BCDB-42F3-9E5B-45957647FFD7%28Office.14%29.aspx) to ensure that they're seeing times and dates properly in Project Online. <br/> |

 <br/> |**Want to use groups to manage who's doing what in Project Online?** You can set up Project Online to use the same Active Directory groups you might already have set up in SharePoint Online. This can make it a little easier to keep track of who's doing what across the different tools in your organization. <br/> If you want to go this route:  <br/>
