## What you get with Project Online
<a name="_what1"> </a>

Project Online is the web-based solution that the entire project team can use for all aspects of project management, resource management, and project portfolio management (PPM) of multiple projects across the organization:
  
    
    

- **Project managers** can set up their project schedules and assign tasks to team members.
    
  
- **Resource managers** can balance broad sets of resource requirements by setting up resource pools with detailed information about skill sets, availability, and costs.
    
  
- **Team members** can track their work in timesheets and submit status information against their assigned tasks, and also see the big picture of their project and task dependencies.
    
  
- **Portfolio managers** can view and analyze the collection of projects for schedule, cost, resources, and more.
    
  
- **Executives can** see the high-level view of projects and their priorities, and make sure that projects align with the organization's strategic goals.
    
  
As a cloud-hosted PPM service, you get Project Online through Office 365. It's an alternative to Project Server, the on-premises PPM product. With Project Online hosted, you have no up-front infrastructure costs to implement PPM for your organization, and you can immediately configure and use Project Web App to manage projects, resources, and portfolios.

## What you get with Project Professional
<a name="_what2"> </a>

Project Professional is the desktop solution which offers robust tools for professional project managers to schedule and track projects. Unlike a PPM environment in which many users access the application, project managers typically are the only ones using Project Professional, although they can easily share information through views and reports with the project team and stakeholders.
  
    
    
Project Professional is a desktop project management application. When included with your Project Online subscription, the application is continually updated and available as long as the subscription is current.
