Email notifications in Project Web App can help you stay on top of what's coming, when things are due, and what's on your plate. Some notifications are set up by your manager, and other notifications are available for you to set up for yourself:

 <br/> |**I need constant reminders to keep me on track.** <br/> | I want to know when: <br/> **A task I'm assigned to isn't done yet.** Under **Tasks**, choose **Send me a reminder about my incomplete tasks**.  <br/> **A status report isn't submitted yet.** Under **Status Reports**, choose **Send me a reminder until my status reports have been submitted or they become overdue**.  <br/>  When you want this kind of detail, you should really plan out how often you realistically want email. <br/>  For example, you might want: <br/>  A one-week heads-up on task start dates. <br/>  Task due date reminders every other day, starting a week before the task is due. <br/>  Overdue notices every day, starting 3 days after the task is due. <br/>  Reminders every week of all tasks that are incomplete. <br/>  Project Web App does try to combine notifications into a single email, so your Inbox won't really be flooded with reminders, but you may get something every day, depending on how many tasks you have on your plate. Especially because your project manager or resource manager may also have some reminders they've asked Project Web App to send, as well. Spend some time really thinking about what notifications would be the most helpful to you, and if you find that you're just getting too much mail from Project Web App, you can fine-tune it later. <br/> |
