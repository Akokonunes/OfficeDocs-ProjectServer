## Parameters



|**Parameter**|**Required**|**Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Identity_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |Microsoft.Office.Project.Server.Cmdlet.PsiServiceApplicationPipeBind  <br/> |The name of the Project Service Application to test against.  <br/> |
| _AssignmentCollection_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.SharePoint.PowerShell.SPAssignmentCollection  <br/> |Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal. Use of objects, such as **SPWeb** or **SPSite**, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management. Using the **SPAssignment** object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory. When **SPWeb**, **SPSite**, or **SPSiteAdministration** objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the **Global** parameter is not used. <br/> > [!NOTE]> When the **Global** parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store. If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the **Stop-SPAssignment** command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.          |
| _Rule_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Office.Project.Server.HealthRules.ProjectServiceApplicationHealthRuleName  <br/> |Which rule to run against the service application: All | QueueServiceInternalState | QueueInFlightJobs | CalcServiceWorkerState | DatabasePermissions  <br/> |
