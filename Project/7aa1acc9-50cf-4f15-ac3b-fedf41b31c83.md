Risks are things that can impact a project's schedule, and that you're aware of when the project is planned. These may be things like an upcoming personnel change, or a tight turnaround time on a particular deliverable. By planning for a project's risks ahead of time, project managers are better able to manage the project schedule.

If the risk isn't specific to any one task, simply add it to the project site.
  
    
    

1. Click **Projects** on the Quick Launch.

6. Add information about the risk, including as many details as you can.
    
    
  
    
    
![Risks form](images/b5158759-3669-467f-ad42-e9d19336459f.png)
  
    
    

  
    
    

  
    
    

    
    
    
    The **Probability**, **Impact** (which is a general score, in comparison with other risks), and **Cost** of the risk help the project manager understand the risk, at a glance.
    
    
  
    
    
![Probability, Impact, and Cost](images/a2ba462a-24bb-408d-b1fc-23335dcd3800.png)
  
    
    

  
    
    

  
    
    

    
    
    
    The **Description** should cover why the risk is a possibility, and what will happen if it occurs.
    
    
  
    
    
![Description](images/e7504bb4-b9d2-453f-8d69-6b42392477f5.png)
  
    
    

  
    
    

  
    
    

    
    
    
    The **Mitigation Plan** is what you need to do to try to avoid the risk occurring.

    The **Contingency Plan** is what you're going to do if the risk actually does occur.

    The **Trigger Description** and **Trigger** are the things that will happen that will indicate when the risk is occurring, and when you need to put the contingency plan into action.

## Want to link this risk to a specific task?
<a name="__top"> </a>

After you've initially saved the risk, you can go back in and link it to a specific task, or to multiple tasks. The risk may be related to specific tasks in the project, and by linking the risk to these tasks, you give yourself a reminder of where you need to keep an eye on things.
  
    
    

1. Click the name of the risk in the list, to view it.
    
    
  
    
    
![Click the risk in the Title column](images/ddf4da0c-a3cf-426f-9cc9-34bc7738c3cd.png)
  
    
    

  
    
    

  
    
    

    
    
    
  
2. In the lower-right portion of the page, click **Add Related Item**.
