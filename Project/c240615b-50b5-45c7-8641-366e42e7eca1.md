After you have created a project in Project Web App, you may decide that it should use a different project template than the one used when it was created. For example, your organization may use different templates for projects owned by different groups. When the project was created, it was unclear which group would be working on it. As the project details are defined, it becomes obvious that it should be using a different group's template. You can change the template for a project in Project Web App.
  
    
    


> [!NOTE]
>  When you update the template used by a project, the workflow, pages, and custom fields for the project may also be updated.
  
    
    

To change a project's template:
1. On the Quick Launch, click **Projects**.
    
  
2. Click once in the row for the project you want to change, to select it.
    
  
3. On the **Projects** tab, in the **Project Type** group, click **Change**.
    
  
4. Read the notes about changing the template, and then, if you are okay with the changes that will be made, select the new template from the **New Project Type** list, and click **OK**.
    
  

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are changing between a basic project template and an enterprise project template, note that basic project tasks are managed outside of Project Web App, in a task list, and enterprise project tasks are managed from within Project Web App.
