# Turn Roadmap on or off for your organization

Office 365 admins can turn the Project Online Roadmap feature on or off for their organization through their Microsoft 365 Admin settings.

## Considerations about Roadmap data deletion

Before using the Roadmap feature, admins should understand more about deleting Roadmap data, should they need to do this in the future.
  
You can turn Roadmap off in the Microsoft 365 admin center. This will prevent your users from using Roadmap, but will not remove any user data that currently exists. 

If your Project Online subscription ends, most of the associated data is deleted in conformance with the [Data Retention, Deletion, and Destruction in Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/office-365-data-retention-deletion-and-destruction-overview). Unlike other Project Online data, Roadmap data isnâ€™t automatically deleted after when your Project Online subscription ends.

For more information details about deleting Roadmap data, see 
[Remove Roadmap from Office 365](remove-roadmap-from-office-365.md).

## Turn Roadmap on or off

An Office 365 admin can do the following to turn Roadmap on or off for their organization:
 
 
1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, under **Settings**, click **Services & add-ins**.
2. Click **Project Online**.
3. Set **Turn Roadmap on or off for your entire organization** to On or Off.
4. Click **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are currently using Microsoft 365 admin center preview, you need to [switch from preview back to the classic experience](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/microsoft-365-admin-center-preview?view=o365-worldwide#switch-to-preview-and-back-again) to see the Project Online settings to turn Roadmap on or off. 
    
## If you aren't able to turn on Roadmap

In the following conditions, you will not be able to turn on Roadmap:

### Roadmap is not yet available to your organization

The Roadmap feature is being gradually rolled out to organizations over a period of time, similar to how other [Office 365 features are made available](https://support.office.com/article/when-do-i-get-the-newest-features-in-for-office-365-da36192c-58b9-4bc9-8d51-bb6eed468516).

If you see this message, it simply means that Roadmap hasn't been made available yet to your tenant, but should be shortly.

### Roadmap is not yet available in your region

Per the Online Services Terms, specific countries have requirements for data storage within that country or region for Project Online. If you see this message, it means that Roadmap is not currently available in your region.

Roadmap requires Business Application Platform support in your specific country.  For the current list of countries and regions supported by the Business Application Platform, please go to [here](https://www.microsoft.com/TrustCenter/CloudServices/business-application-platform/data-location).
