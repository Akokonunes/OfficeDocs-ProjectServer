# Remove Project Roadmap from Office 365

You can turn Project Roadmap off in the Microsoft 365 admin center. This will prevent your users from using Roadmap, but will not remove any user data that currently exists.

1. In the [Microsoft 365 amin center](https://admin.microsoft.com), under **Settings**, click **Services & add-ins**.
2. Click **Project Online**.
3. Set **Turn Roadmap on or off for your entire organization** to **Off**.

If your Project Online subscription ends, most of the associated data is deleted in conformance with the [Data Retention, Deletion, and Destruction in Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/office-365-data-retention-deletion-and-destruction-overview). Unlike other Project Online data, Roadmap data isnâ€™t automatically deleted after 90 days when your Project Online subscription ends.

You can remove all roadmap data by removing the entire Roadmap solution from Microsoft 365. This will delete all of the existing roadmaps and associated user data.

1. In the [Microsoft 365 amin center](https://admin.microsoft.com), under **Admin centers**, click Dynamics 365.
2. In the Dynamics 365 Administraton Center, select the default instance, and then click **Open**.
3. On the **Settings** menu, under **Customization**, click **Solutions**.
4. Select the **PortfolioService** solution, and then click **Delete**.
5. Select the **PortfolioService_Anchor** solution, and then click **Delete**.
