# Set up another Project Online site

  
You may decide that you want to set up an additional Project Online site, to manage projects in a separate environment from your first Project Online site. You can do this by creating another site collection with Project Web App.
  
 **To set up another Project Online site:**
  
1. [Where to sign in to Office 365 for business](https://support.office.com/article/e9eb7d51-5430-4929-91ab-6157c5a050b4) with your work or school account. 
    
2. Select the app launcher icon ![The app launcher icon in Office 365](media/7502f4ec-3c9a-435d-a7b4-b9cda85189a7.png) in the upper-left and choose **Admin**.

3. In the lower-left navigation, expand **Admin Centers** and open the **SharePoint** admin center.

7. Fill out the rest of the boxes, including the following:
    
  - **Administrator** Enter the name of the administrator for the site collection. 
    
  - **Storage Quota** Enter the maximum amount of memory you want to dedicate to storage for Project Online. The recommendation is at least 200 MB. This figure affects performance. 
    
  - Server Resource Quota Enter the maximum number of server resources you want to use in Project Online. The recommendation is at least 300 server resources. This figure affects performance.
