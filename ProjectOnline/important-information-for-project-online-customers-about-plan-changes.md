> [!NOTE]
> For an overview of features and pricing for the new Project Online subscription plans, see [Project cloud-based solutions plans and pricing site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=823442). For more detailed information, see the [Project Online Service Description](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=823443). 
  
## How does this affect me?

If you currently have a Project Online subscription for one of the retired plans, the change won't affect you right away. We want to give you enough time to prepare for the change in plans. With this in mind, the following describes the different options available to you:
  
### I am a new customer

If you are a new customer (do not currently have a Project Online subscription plan) you can sign up for the new plans. The retired plans will no longer be available to you.
  
### I am on a retired plan, but still want to use it for a while

If you are using one of the retired plans, you can continue to use it until your agreement expires. If your agreement expires on or before December 31, 2016, you have the option to renew your current plan for an additional term. For example, if you are using Project for Office 365 and your agreement expires on December 30, 2016, when you renew, you can choose to use it for one more term. Or you can choose to move to a new plan if you want. It's up to you.
  
While you are using a retired plan, you are free to add additional users on the retired plan. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> If your agreement expires after December 31, 2016 and you want to renew, you will need to select one of the new plans. 
  
### I am on a retired plan, but want to switch to a new plan right now

You don't have to wait until your plan expires to switch to one of the new subscription plans. Starting September 1, 2016, you can switch from a retired plan to a new plan at any time.
  
## Which plan is right for my users?

While a detailed list of what each product can do is available in the [Project Online Service Description](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=823443), the three new plans are targeted towards distinct roles:
  
|**Plan**|**Target users**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Project Online Essentials  <br/> |Team members  <br/> |
|Project Online Professional  <br/> |Project managers  <br/> |
|Project Online Premium  <br/> |Portfolio managers, Resource managers  <br/> |
   
If your users are on a retired plan and you are planning to move them to a new plan, this makes it easier to determine which new plan you might want to move them to, since the retired plans were also made with distinct roles in mind. 
  
|**If you previously used this**|**You most likely will want this**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Project Lite  <br/> |Project Online Essentials  <br/> |
|Project for Office 365 (Project Pro for Office 365)  <br/> |Project Online Professional  <br/> |
|Project Online  <br/> |Project Online Premium  <br/> |
|Project Online with Project Pro for Office 365  <br/> |Project Online Premium/Project Online Professional  <br/> |
   
The big difference between Project Online Professional and Project Online Premium is that the latter has additional capabilities for portfolio planning, demand management, enterprise resource management, and out-of-the-box portfolio reporting. You can learn more about the differences between plans in the [Project Online Service Description](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=823443).
  
## I'm on a retired plan - what do I need to do?

If you currently subscribe to one of the retired Project Online plans, for the most part you don't really need to take action until you are ready to renew your licenses as you near your agreement expiration date. The following table describes what you need to do upon renewal and the options that are available to you, depending on the existing plan you are on.
  
|****If you are on this plan****|****What you need to do during the terms of your current agreement****|****What to do upon renewal (if your agreement ends on or before December 31, 2016)****|****What to do upon renewal (if your agreement ends after December 31, 2016)****|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Project Lite  <br/> |No action needed.  <br/>  *Your current Project Lite licenses will automatically be renamed to **Project Online Essentials**. *  <br/> |Renew to Project Online Essentials  <br/> |Renew to Project Online Essentials  <br/> |
|Project for Office 365 (previously known as Project Pro for Office 365)  <br/> |No action needed.  <br/> | Renew to one of the following options:  <br/>  Project for Office 365 (renew to your old plan)  <br/>  Project Online Professional (renew to a new plan)  <br/> |Renew to Project Online Professional  <br/> |
|Project Online  <br/> |No action needed.  <br/>  *Your current Project Online licenses will automatically be renamed to **Project Online Premium without Project Client**. *  <br/> | Renew to one of the following options:  <br/>  Project Online without Project Client (renew to your old plan)  <br/>  Project Online Premium (renew to a new plan)  <br/> |Renew to Project Online Premium  <br/> |
|Project Online with Project for Office 365  <br/> |No action needed.  <br/> | Renew to one of the following:  <br/>  Project Online with Project for Office 365 (renew to your old plan)  <br/>  Project Online Professional (renew to a new plan)  <br/>  Project Online Premium (renew to a new plan)  <br/> |Renew to Project Online Professional or Project Online Premium based on what your user needs to do.  <br/> |
   
## What do I need to do to assign my users to a new plan?

[Switch to a different Office 365 for business plan](https://support.office.com/article/73318661-8f33-478b-bcc7-fb8d69dbb22a) is relatively easy to do. You will be able to switch plans either manually or through the Switch Plans Wizard. 
  
The Switch Plans Wizard leads you through the process of buying a plan that you can switch your current plan to, reassigns all new user's licenses, and cancels your old plan. Note that you must be switching all of your Office 365 users to a new plan in order to use the Switch Plans Wizard.
  
If you are not able to use the Switch Plan Wizard, you can [Switch Office 365 for business plans manually](https://support.office.com/article/eb0d0680-5677-41a0-8c46-4b9d47f1c209) as well. 
  
## What happens to my data when I switch plans?

You users will not lose any of their data when they switch to a new plan. While your users may see a change in the capabilities available to them by going to the new plan, their data will be untouched. 
  
## How will I know when I need to make a decision on my plan?

If you have access to the Office 365 admin portal, you'll see posts in the Message Center (part of the [About the Office 365 admin center](https://support.office.com/article/758befc4-0888-4009-9f14-0d147402fd23)) with information on when you need to take action. In the meantime, you can renew your subscription and add more licenses as usual. 
  
## How can I add additional licenses if I am still using a retired Project plan?

If you are a customer with an existing Enterprise Agreement that is on a retired Project plan, you are allowed to order and add more licenses if need within your current Enterprise Agreement enrollment period. You can do this even though the retired plans do not appear on the Customer Price Sheet or in the [Volume Licensing Service Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=826364). Please contact your partner (licensed service provider) for assistance on ordering retired Project Online plans. If you have any issues finding your partner, please contact your local Licensing Sales Specialist.
