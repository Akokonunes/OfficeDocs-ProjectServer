# Delete user data from Project Roadmap

If your Project Online subscription ends, most of the associated data is deleted in conformance with the [Data Retention, Deletion, and Destruction in Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/office-365-data-retention-deletion-and-destruction-overview). Unlike other Project Online data, Roadmap data isnâ€™t automatically deleted after 90 days when your Project Online subscription ends. However, you can delete it manually by using the following procedure:


1. In the [Microsoft 365 amin center](https://admin.microsoft.com), under **Admin centers**, click Dynamics 365.
2. In the Dynamics 365 Administraton Center, select the default instance, and then click **Open**.
3. Click the **PortfolioService** solution.
4.
