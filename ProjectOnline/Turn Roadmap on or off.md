# Turn Roadmap on or off for your organization

Office 365 admins can turn the Project Online Roadmap feature on or off for their organization through their Microsoft 365 Admin settings.

To learn more about Roadmap, see the [Project Training Center](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/project-training-63f1db89-1ee0-4113-bedc-03fc5ec6223a).

## Considerations about Roadmap data deletion

Before using the Roadmap feature, admins should understand more about deleting Roadmap data, should they need to do this in the future.
  
You can turn Project Roadmap off in the Microsoft 365 admin center. This will prevent your users from using Roadmap, but will not remove any user data that currently exists. 

If your Project Online subscription ends, most of the associated data is deleted in conformance with the Data Retention, Deletion, and Destruction in Office 365. Unlike other Project Online data, Roadmap data isnâ€™t automatically deleted after 90 days when your Project Online subscription ends.

For more information details about deleting Roadmap data, see 
[Remove Roadmap from Office 365](remove-roadmap-from-office-365.md).

## Turn Roadmap on or off

An Office 365 admin can do the following to turn Roadmap on or off for their organization:
 
 
1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, under **Settings**, click **Services & add-ins**.
2. Click **Project Online**.
3. Set Turn Roadmap on or off for your entire organization to On or Off.
4. Click **Save**.

## If you aren't able to turn on Roadmap

In the following conditions, you will not be able to turn on Roadmap:

### Roadmap is not yet available to your organization

The Roadmap feature is gradually rolled out to organizations to make sure 

If you see this message, it simply means that Roadmap hasn't been made available yet to your tenant, but should be shortly.

### Roadmap requires CDS for Apps on your default instance

The Roadmap feature requires the Common Data Source (CDS) for Apps in order to work.

If you see this message, it means that you don't have the required version of CDS for Apps and you need to upgrade.  Follow the link provided for information about upgrading to CDS for Apps.

### Roadmap is not yet available in your region

Some countries have requirements for data storage locations for cloud-based solutions.

If you see this message, it means that Roadmap is not currently available in your region for this reason.
